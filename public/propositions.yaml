  name: "Measure N: First Responder Student Loan and Training Reimbursement Fund"
  description: "Measure N proposes creating a fund to reimburse student loans and cover job-related educational expenses for first responders employed by the City of San Francisco, such as police officers, firefighters, paramedics, registered nurses, and 911 dispatchers."
  summary: "Measure N establishes the First Responder Student Loan Forgiveness Fund, allowing the City to reimburse up to $25,000 of student loans and education-related expenses for eligible first responders after they have worked in the city for at least three consecutive years. The goal is to improve recruitment and retention of these essential public safety workers."
  fiscal_impact:
    short_term: "Minimal costs of up to $315,000 annually for administering the program, including staffing needs."
    long_term: "The long-term cost depends on future City budgets and contributions to the fund, but this could reduce turnover and staffing shortages in critical public safety roles."

    - description: "Prevents setting a precedent for using public funds to cover personal debts for certain employees."
      counterargument: "The program is seen as an investment in public safety, helping to retain vital personnel."
